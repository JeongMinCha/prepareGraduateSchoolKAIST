1. Show, using a proof or an example, that if P(A|B,C) = P(A|C), then P(A,B|C) = P(A|C)P(B|C)
yields the original vector multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue Î». What is the 010
1. An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v that, when multiplied by A,
eigenvector of (0 1 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3) corresponding to the eigenvalue 3? 003
1. In A* search, the evaluation function is defined as follows: f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost so far to reach n, and h(n) is the estimated cost from n to goal. We call h(n) the heuristic function. Under what condition is A* search guaranteed to find the optimal solution? If we want to design an admissible heuristic, what condition does h(n) need to satisfy?
